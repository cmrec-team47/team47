A website for CMR


This website is created using wordpress. We made this website to make the sudents more and more involved with the college
than they do on a regular basis. Any Events that are going on in the college will be posted on this website. They can also
order food or any other beverage they want to have from the comfort of their phone. This will be a huge change from stading 
in the crowd and getting a token and then the meal is prepped. Students can give an order before the lunch starts they wont
have to wait in a huge line in order to get the food.

This website also has a lost and found feature. Many students always complain about missing items like IDs,phones,earphones,money
wallets etc., Most of those students wont cant go to every class and section and ask for their lost items.
So they just post a photo of their lost item in the lost and found section, The person who found the item will respond to it.

The activty section is where all the events regarding colleges will be posted , This will help in getting the awareness of what is 
going on in different colleges.
Students can also post complaints regarding the cleanliness of their own repective class and college and the respective authorities 
can take a charge on that.

Thus this webiste meets all the basic requirements a student needs.

If there are additional requirements, Please let us know and we will try our best to include those requirements.
